# Development Scripts

This directory contains scripts useful for development, demonstration, and testing:

## Scripts

- `demo_agent.py`: Interactive demo of the MCPAgent's functionality. Useful for manual testing and demonstrations.
- `demo_components.py`: Test individual components (calendar, weather, notes) in isolation. Helpful for troubleshooting.
- `demo_data.py`: Populate the system with sample data for development and testing.

## Usage

Run any script directly with Python:
```bash
python scripts/demo_agent.py      # Interactive agent demo
python scripts/demo_components.py # Test individual components
python scripts/demo_data.py      # Create sample data
```

Note: These scripts are for development purposes only and should not be used in production.
